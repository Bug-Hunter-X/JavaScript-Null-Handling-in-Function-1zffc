# JavaScript Null Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error when handling null values in JavaScript and shows a straightforward solution.

The `bug.js` file contains a function that incorrectly handles null values, leading to potential unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to correctly handle these values to prevent errors.

## Problem
In JavaScript, null values can easily cause errors if not handled correctly.  This example showcases a simple function that may produce unexpected results when dealing with null inputs. 

## Solution
The solution is to explicitly check for null values and handle them appropriately.  The `bugSolution.js` provides this improved handling.

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the JavaScript files to see the error and solution in action.
